# DELLEMC-DPS-ReST-api for PowerProtect
You will find after GA date postman_collection.json and postman_environment.json files which are the collection and the environment variables I am using to make things more transparent. I do recommend to import both files into Postman so you can work with. Do not forget to set the environment you have imported so the DDMC host variable is available  
You'll find the latest ReST API description with the following webpage http://developer.dellemc.com/
