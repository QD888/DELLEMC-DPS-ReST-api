# DELLEMC-DPS-ReST-api for PowerProtect
You will find auter GA date postman_collection.json and postman_environment.json files which are the collection and the environment variables I am using to make things more transparent. I do recommend to import both files into Postman so you can work with. Do not forget to set the environment you have imported so the DDMC host variable is available
