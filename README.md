# DELLEMC-DPS-ReST-api
ReST api for DELL EMC DPS products like NetWorker, DataDomain, Avamar, and more

This repository contains many ReST API collection for Postman https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/.  
In this Postman collections I do work with an envirnment (_env) where I define all variables needed to work with the ReST Api like Server or login or auth token where needed and the api collection (_col) where I do use this varibales. So make sure you do import the environment plus the collection

When having a swagger api file like NetWorker you can use http://editor.swagger.io/#/ and add the swagger file so you do have better option to see what we can use.

There are ReST API commands for NetWorker, Avamar, DataDomain and more will follow
