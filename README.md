# DELLEMC-DPS-ReST-api
ReST api for DELL EMC DPS products like NetWorker, DataDomain, Avamar, and more

This repository contains many ReST API collection for Postman https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/.  
In this Postman collections I do work with an environment (postman_environment.json) where I define all variables needed to work with the ReST Api like Server or login or auth token where needed and the api collection (postman_collection.json) where I do use this variable. So make sure you do import the environment plus the collection


When having a swagger api file like NetWorker you can use http://editor.swagger.io/#/ and add the swagger file so you do have better option to see what we can use.  

Another nice online tool to view the json output will be the [json online editor](https://jsoneditoronline.org/)  

Both will help you to view the swagger file either by copy and paste or upload a exported file into these tools.
