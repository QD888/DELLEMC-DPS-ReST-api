# DELLEMC-DPS-ReST-api DataDomain Management Console
You will find postman_collection.json and postman_environment.json files which are the collection and the environment variables I am using to make things more transparent. I do recommend to import both files into Postman so you can work with. Do not forget to set the environment you have imported so the DDMC host variable is available

# Content
* DDMC  
  * environment variables
  * Authenticate against DDMC Server


  as of today there is no openapi like Rest included so you need to use the attached postman collection.
