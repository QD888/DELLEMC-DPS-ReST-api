# DELLEMC-DPS-ReST-api NetWorker 18.2

When having a swagger api file like NetWorker you can use http://editor.swagger.io/#/ and add the swagger file so you do have better option to see what we can use. Use adminstrator and password for login.
NetWorker always uses this swagger file: https://{{server}}:9090/nwrestapi/v3/schemas/swagger.json

You will find postman_collection.json and files which are the collection and the environment variables I am using to make things more transparent.
